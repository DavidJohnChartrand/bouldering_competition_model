## Project Inspirations

Bouldering is an incredibly demanding and exciting sport that requires not only strength and endurance, but also mental agility and problem-solving skills. As the popularity of the sport continues to grow, the competition level becomes increasingly fierce, making it even more challenging for new and upcoming climbers to make their mark what that in mind we aimed to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the next nation player of bouldering that would be the winner that we could contribuite to revolutionize the way approach talent identification in this dynamic and rapidly-evolving sport, and empower climbers worldwide to achieve their dreams and push the boundaries of what's possible.

## Targeted Shareholders

Private companies, particularly those in the climbing gear, gym, or outdoor expedition industries, may have a strong interest in identifying and supporting promising bouldering athletes. This is because top athletes can serve as ambassadors for their brand and help attract new customers. A machine learning model that accurately predicts the next rising star in bouldering can be a valuable tool for these companies, helping them identify and sponsor talented athletes and build their brand within the climbing community.

## Questions to be answered

Can we accurately predict the finalists of the next competition for players based off their previous ratings?

## Conclusion / Findings

We recommend that our stakeholders use our random trees model to help determine brand ambassadors, further they may want to use the features of importance graphics from the analysis to determine specific areas of interest and investigate them further. For example, while selecting brand ambassadors for the company it could be important to look for athletes coming from France and Japan as these two of the countries contribute the most statistically to our model. Athletes coming from these regions will therefore have  increase likelihood to get to the finial and improve the visibility of the brand. 

As the sport continues to grow in the coming year with its second showing at the summer Olympics this give our stakeholder an advantage in picking brand ambassadors. We look forward to continue improving our ability to determining potential winner and finalist as we continue to improve and working these models in the future.
