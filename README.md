## Project Overview:



## Bouldering competition winner



## Project Inspirations

Bouldering is an incredibly demanding and exciting sport that requires not only strength and endurance, but also mental agility and problem-solving skills. As the popularity of the sport continues to grow, the competition level becomes increasingly fierce, making it even more challenging for new and upcoming climbers to make their mark what that in mind we aimed to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the next nation player of bouldering that would be the winner that we could contribuite to revolutionize the way approach talent identification in this dynamic and rapidly-evolving sport, and empower climbers worldwide to achieve their dreams and push the boundaries of what's possible.

# Targeted Shareholders

Private companies, particularly those in the climbing gear, gym, or outdoor expedition industries, may have a strong interest in identifying and supporting promising bouldering athletes. This is because top athletes can serve as ambassadors for their brand and help attract new customers. A machine learning model that accurately predicts the next rising star in bouldering can be a valuable tool for these companies, helping them identify and sponsor talented athletes and build their brand within the climbing community.
